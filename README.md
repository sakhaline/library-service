## Components
### üìö _Books Service_

#### Managing books (CRUD operations)
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
The Books Service in the Library API offers complete
CRUD functionality, including the initialization of 
the "books" app, creation of a book model, and 
implementation of serializers and views for 
essential endpoints. 
Additionally, robust permissions are enforced, ensuring 
that only admin users have the authority to create, 
update, and delete books, while all users, 
including those not authenticated, can access a 
comprehensive list of available books. JWT 
token authentication from the users' service 
enhances security and user-specific interactions 
within the Books Service.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>API Endpoints</summary>

- **POST:** `/books/` - Add a new book
- **GET:** `/books/` - Get a list of books
- **GET:** `/books/<id>/` - Get detailed information about a book
- **PUT/PATCH:** `/books/<id>/` - Update book details (including inventory)
- **DELETE:** `/books/<id>/` - Delete a book
</details>

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ _Users Service_
#### Managing authentication & user registration

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
The Users Service in the Library API implements full 
CRUD functionality, beginning with the initialization 
of the "users" app. This involves adding a user model 
with email support and integrating JWT (JSON Web Token) 
authentication for enhanced security. The implementation includes 
serializers and views for all endpoints, ensuring a 
seamless and secure user management system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>API Endpoints</summary>

### üóí _Borrowings Service_
#### Managing users' borrowings of books

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
The Borrowings Service in the Library API provides robust 
functionality for managing book borrowings. It includes 
the initialization of the borrowing app, a model with 
constraints for accurate tracking, and a read serializer 
for detailed book information. The service offers endpoints 
for listing, retrieving details, and creating borrowings, 
with validations for inventory and user permissions. 
Borrowings can be marked as returned, triggering inventory 
updates, and notifications are sent for new borrowings and 
overdue items. Telegram integration enables real-time 
notifications, and a scheduled task checks for daily 
overdue borrowings, providing detailed alerts or a 
notification of no overdue borrowings. This service ensures 
efficient borrowing processes and timely communication with users.
